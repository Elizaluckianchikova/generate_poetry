# NeuroPoet Project

## Overview
The NeuroPoet project aims to develop a sophisticated program capable of generating poetic texts using neural network-based text generation algorithms. This initiative seeks to explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and creative writing, pushing the boundaries of what machines can achieve in the realm of poetry.

## Objectives
- **Study Text Generation Algorithms:** Delve into the latest neural network algorithms designed for text generation to understand their capabilities and limitations in the context of poetry.
- **Train the Model:** Utilize a corpus of poetic texts to train the neural network model, ensuring it captures the nuances of poetic language.
- **Develop a Web Interface:** Create an intuitive web-based interface that allows users to interact with the NeuroPoet, making the experience accessible and engaging.

## Challenges
Despite the promising potential of creating a neural poet capable of producing high-quality and original poetry, several challenges must be addressed:

1. **Formalization of Poetic Language:** Poetry is not just about meaning; it involves rhythm, rhyme, imagery, and subtext. The formal structure of a poem can be complex and challenging to capture algorithmically.
2. **Quality Assessment:** Evaluating the "goodness" of a generated poem is subjective and difficult to quantify. Traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE primarily measure similarity to the training corpus rather than artistic merit.
